# SGEMM
The dataset measures running time for a 2048x2048 matrix-matrix product using a SGEMM GPU kernel across 241,600 feasible parameter combinations. It includes 14 parameters, with 10 ordinal and 4 binary, and reports 4 run times per combination. This helps analyze kernel performance and optimize GPU efficiency in matrix operations.
